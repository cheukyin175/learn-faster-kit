# FASTER Framework Reference

The FASTER framework is a comprehensive learning methodology designed to optimize learning speed and retention. Each component addresses a critical aspect of the learning process.

## F - Forget

**Purpose:** Remove distractions and preconceptions to enable laser focus.

**Three things to forget:**

1. **What you already know** - Approach new material with a beginner's mind. Existing knowledge can create blind spots and prevent absorption of new information.

2. **Distractions** - Remove environmental and mental distractions. Create a dedicated learning space and time.

3. **Limitations** - Suspend beliefs about your learning capacity. Don't let past experiences limit future potential.

**Implementation:**
- Start each learning session by acknowledging what you think you know, then consciously set it aside
- Create a distraction-free environment (phone away, notifications off)
- Use mindfulness techniques to clear mental clutter before learning

**Quote:** "Your mind is like a parachute—it only works when it's open."

## A - Act

**Purpose:** Transform passive consumption into active creation.

**Core Principle:** The brain learns more through creation than consumption.

**Active Learning Strategies:**

1. **Take notes** - Don't just read, write. Summarize in your own words.

2. **Ask questions** - Engage with the material actively. Question assumptions and explore implications.

3. **Apply immediately** - Practice what you learn right away. Build something, solve a problem, explain to someone.

4. **Test yourself** - Regular self-testing strengthens memory pathways.

5. **Highlight strategically** - Mark only truly important concepts. If everything is highlighted, nothing stands out.

**Implementation:**
- Write summaries after each learning session
- Create examples that apply the concept
- Build small projects to practice new skills
- Explain concepts aloud as you learn them

## S - State

**Purpose:** Optimize emotional and physical state for learning.

**Core Principle:** Learning is state-dependent. Your emotional and physical condition directly impacts learning effectiveness.

**State Components:**

1. **Psychology (Thoughts)** - Your mindset and emotional state
2. **Physiology (Body)** - Your physical condition and energy level

**State Optimization:**

- **Curiosity** - Approach learning with genuine interest
- **Enthusiasm** - Generate excitement about the topic
- **Energy** - Ensure adequate sleep, nutrition, and physical activity
- **Focus** - Use techniques like Pomodoro to maintain concentration
- **Relaxation** - Reduce stress and anxiety that block learning

**Memory Connection:** Information + Emotion = Long-term Memory

**Implementation:**
- Check your state before learning sessions
- Use music, movement, or breathing to shift state if needed
- Associate positive emotions with learning activities
- Take breaks to maintain optimal energy levels

## T - Teach

**Purpose:** Deepen understanding by explaining concepts to others.

**Core Principle:** Teaching a concept requires mastering it at a deeper level than merely understanding it.

**Benefits:**

1. **Learn twice** - Once when studying, again when teaching
2. **Identify gaps** - Teaching reveals what you don't understand
3. **Improve retention** - Explaining reinforces memory pathways
4. **Enhance clarity** - Simplifying for others clarifies your own thinking

**Teaching Methods:**

- **Explain to a friend** - Find someone to teach the concept to
- **Write explanations** - Blog posts, notes, or documentation
- **Create tutorials** - Step-by-step guides or videos
- **Answer questions** - Participate in forums or study groups
- **Rubber duck method** - Explain to an inanimate object (forces clarity)

**Preparation Effect:** Knowing you'll teach changes how you learn. You:
- Pay closer attention
- Take better notes
- Ask better questions
- Seek deeper understanding

**Implementation:**
- Plan to teach each concept you learn
- Schedule teaching sessions with study partners
- Write explanations in your learning log
- Create teaching exercises in your progress tracking

---

## E - Enter

**Purpose:** Schedule learning to ensure consistent progress.

**Core Principle:** What doesn't get scheduled doesn't get done.

**Calendar Strategy:**

Learning should be treated with the same importance as work meetings, appointments, and commitments.

**What to Schedule:**

1. **Learning sessions** - Dedicated time blocks for studying
2. **Review sessions** - Spaced repetition reviews
3. **Practice time** - Hands-on application
4. **Teaching sessions** - Time to explain to others
5. **Reflection time** - Reviewing progress and adjusting strategy

**Time Blocking Tips:**

- **Consistency** - Same time each day builds habit
- **Realistic blocks** - Don't over-schedule; quality over quantity
- **Buffer time** - Include breaks and transition time
- **Protection** - Treat learning time as non-negotiable
- **Flexibility** - Allow for rescheduling, not canceling

**Implementation:**
- Add learning blocks to your calendar at the start of each week
- Set reminders for review sessions
- Track completion to build accountability
- Adjust schedule based on what works

## R - Review

**Purpose:** Combat the forgetting curve through spaced repetition.

**Core Principle:** Repeated exposure at increasing intervals dramatically improves long-term retention.

**The Forgetting Curve:**

Without review, we forget approximately:
- 50% within 1 hour
- 70% within 24 hours
- 90% within 1 week

**Spaced Repetition Schedule:**

Review material at increasing intervals:
1. **1 day** after learning
2. **3 days** after first review
3. **7 days** after second review
4. **14 days** after third review
5. **30 days** after fourth review
6. **60 days** after fifth review
7. **90 days** after sixth review

**Active Recall:**

Don't just re-read. Instead:
- **Test yourself** - Try to recall without looking
- **Explain from memory** - Recreate understanding without notes
- **Apply in new contexts** - Use the knowledge differently
- **Connect to other concepts** - Build a knowledge network

**Pre-Session Review:**

Before each new learning session:
1. Spend 2-5 minutes recalling previous session's content
2. Review key concepts without looking at notes first
3. Then check notes to verify and fill gaps
4. This primes your brain for new information

**Implementation:**
- Use the review scheduler to track review dates
- Set calendar reminders for review sessions
- Review before each new learning session
- Track which concepts need more review attention

## Integration

**Using FASTER Together:**

1. **F** - Clear your mind and remove distractions
2. **A** - Engage actively with the material
3. **S** - Ensure optimal learning state
4. **T** - Plan to teach what you learn
5. **E** - Schedule dedicated learning time
6. **R** - Review at spaced intervals

**Success Formula:**

```
Learning Effectiveness =
  (Focus × Active Engagement × Optimal State × Teaching)
  × Scheduled Time × Spaced Review
```

Each component multiplies effectiveness. Missing any component significantly reduces results.
